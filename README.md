# Hand-Drawn Electrical Component Symbol Classification

This repository contains a project focused on the classification of hand-drawn electrical component symbols. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and categorizing various hand-drawn symbols representing electrical components.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of hand-drawn electrical component symbols. It has been carefully curated and labeled, ensuring a diverse range of symbols representative of the desired classification task. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing subsets to facilitate model development, evaluation, and performance assessment.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or specify any other installation process)

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset: [Instructions on how to preprocess the dataset, such as resizing, normalization, or feature extraction]
2. Train the model: [Instructions on how to train the model using the provided dataset]
3. Evaluate the model: [Instructions on how to evaluate the trained model on the testing subset]
4. Predict with the model: [Instructions on how to use the trained model for making predictions on new hand-drawn electrical component symbols]
